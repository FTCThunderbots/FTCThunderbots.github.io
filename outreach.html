Our team has fallen in love with the mission and is using our outreach activities to spread the vision.  We have learned through our multiple outreach activities that helping others is fun and rewarding, and that we also learn from it. We outreach to our community by visiting schools and other groups, as well as working with adult mentors.</h3>

                        <p>We were approached by Kayla Truong to help her with a project of trying to get sleeping bags ready for the winter in Portland. Kayla ordered 30 sleeping bags with small defects in them from a wholesaler, for a low price so that she would be able to provide as many sleeping bags as possible. Then, we helped Kayla by sewing/mending some of the sleeping bag, and closing up any holes by the zippers or the feet.</p>

                        <p>The Thunderbots worked together with Mountain View’s Team up! Club to create small craft kits for the waiting rooms of St. Jude’s children hospital. We put together some paper butterflies and some pipe cleaner antennae, and enclosed some crayons for the kids to decorate and doodle on the butterflies. With about 15 combined members of both clubs, we created around 75 craft kits. The craft kits give children something to do while they are waiting, and can help brighten their days a little bit.</p>

We went to the State Competition to show the rookie members what a larger competition looks like, and how a larger competition works (divisions etc). It was a lot of fun to see Hot Wired 7013, last years’ world champions, Batteries in Black 4855, Team Afoofa 5939, and Team Axis 6517. We got to watch the finals of the competition, and it was super cool to watch the top teams of Oregon State compete against each other.</p>

                        <p>The Thunderbots brought our robot, our minibot, as well as our presentation boards to show the 13 teenagers of OMSI’s Teen Science Alliance-Thinkeneers tier what FIRST, and First Tech Challenge is all about. A majority of the students there already had interest in the STEM fields, or science in general, so showing them our robot and what we do as a FIRST team was a lot of fun. We also showed them our programming, and detailed the design process of the robot, and what the various parts of our robot can do. Afterwards we went to all around the museum, competing in paddle boat races, and building a St. Louis arch! We also had some fun with the Van de Graaf generator! </p>

                        <p>Our job here is not to just recruit for FIRST teams, but also to promote STEM, and hopefully motivate some children to get interested in science and robotics, and we definitely achieved that with all the OOHS and AAHs we were getting, as well as “ROBOTS ARE SO COOL!” Getting kids interested in science and robotics is incredibly fun, and nothing beats seeing a kid’s eyes light up when they realize the controller they are holding is moving a robot right before their eyes. This is our second year visiting AWVCS, and as a result of our presentation last year, we had 2 students join FRC teams that advanced to worlds in 2015, and 3 students join FLL teams. This year, there were quite a few students interested in it that happened to go to the same middle school, and we are working to hopefully create a new team at a local middle school. </p>

                        <p>We visited Prestige assisted living and rehabilitation center on May 15th, and showed our robot, and our minibot to the folks there. Almost all of the people there came to our presentation, and they were really excited to see people our age there.It was really interesting to talk to them in general, and they had a lot of cool stories to share about their lives.  We also showed them our mini bot video- and got a few laughs from it too. We talked to them about our team, how much we have learned about robotics, STEM, and ourselves. We also discussed FIRST, all the different levels of it for the different age groups, and we had quite a few excited grandparents that wanted to share this to their grandkids. All in all, the most rewarding aspect of presenting the robot to them was seeing them get so excited over something that has become almost arbitrary to us, and watching them get excited over the robot moving properly. </p>

We created the “Robot Driver’s License” that we handed out to kids after they drove the robot, that had links to the FIRST website, as well as our email to help connect them to a FLL or Jr. FLL team in their area if they are interested. It was really rewarding to be able to see the kids get super excited about getting their driver’s license, and driving the robot. Many kids came back multiple times, and we had over a 100 kids drive our robot in an hour and a half. </p>

We also picked all of the science demos that we would be doing in addition to letting people drive our robot, and we decided on 4 fun and easy demos, a station to let people test out little NXT robots, and to invite another team, Batteries in Black, to have another robot for kids to drive. </p>

We presented to children from kindergarten to fifth grade who were participating in AWVCS summer camp. After giving a brief introduction to our team members and the robot, we talked about the FIRST organization and how FTC fits within it as well as the other tiers. Shortly after, we opened the robot up for the children to drive and ask questions about.  We handed out robot driver’s licenses and let the kids get excited about the science behind the robot, as well as the robot itself.  </p>
