                <h3>FIRST’s mission is to show people of any age that science, technology, and problem solving are enjoyable and enriching.  Our team has fallen in love with the mission and is using our outreach activities to spread the vision.  We have learned through our multiple outreach activities that helping others is fun and rewarding, and that we also learn from it. We outreach to our community by visiting schools and other groups, as well as working with adult mentors.</h3>

                        <p>We brought our robot and part of our team to the HP Family Math and Science Night.  We got the chance to meet and interact with many HP families, with many of the kids, as well as parents eager to learn more about FIRST, and robotics. We referred some kids to an FTC team in their area, and some kids to FLL teams in their area. We also got the chance to meet and discuss our FTC game with team 2471, an FRC team located at Camas High School. We learned a lot from the FRC team, our mentors that we got to see, and from the families and kids we got to meet.</p>

                        <p>Towards the beginning of the school year, our home school, Mountain View, hosts two separate club and activity fairs for students and their families. During the Club fair at lunch, we showed our presentation boards off to students, and invited people to joining our team, or if they were interested in something a little larger, our school districts FRC team. At the second club fair, entire families came up to us, and we presented FIRST robotics, and STEM to families, and invited them to get a closer look at the FIRST program by joining a local junior FLL, FLL, FTC or FRC program. We also got a chance to present our team to our new school principal, as well as some of our teachers, who now excitedly check in with us after every competition.</p>

                        <p>We had our Family Potluck early in the year, getting together every team member, and their families, to welcome them to the Thunderbot Family. We introduced the program and what exactly the Thunderbots do to the parents, as well as presenting this year’s game challenge. We believe that it is extremely important to get the families of each team member involved in the team, as it is impossible to have a successful team without a strong foundation of support from our parents. We also ask any parents that are interested to become mentors for our team, and some of the veteran parents discussed what to expect. Veteran members of the team also presented to the parents, showing them who the team is, and what we do.</p>

                        <p>These are some pictures from the Girls Generation FTC Competition that we participated in over the summer. We mentored three rookie girls, and they learned and drove the robot in matches. Two of the the three girls have joined FTC teams in the Seattle area, and are continually learning more and more about FIRST, and FTC. We also had an opportunity to let some of the girls on our team to drive the robot.  We won the Highest score award at the competition, and got to meet some interesting people at the competition. We hope the rookies that we mentored also learned a lot, and are enjoying their FTC teams.</p>

We also designated members of the Thunderbots to go check in with Rookie teams, and to assist them when and if they needed help. We were also responsible for the set up and teardown of the fields, and cleaning up Covington after the competition ended.</p>
